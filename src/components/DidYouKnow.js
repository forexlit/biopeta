      food, or only eats certain food, the signs of autism might be caused by
      changed gut microflora. </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
      There is growing research that suggests a
      potential link between gut microflora (the collection of microorganisms in
      the gastrointestinal tract) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The gut
      microbiome can influence brain function through several mechanisms, such
      as the production of neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, dopamine),
      regulation of immune responses, and the synthesis of short-chain fatty
      acids (SCFAs), which can affect brain development and function.

      If thatâ€™s
      the case, you can see a significant improvement in children behaviour and
      significant reduction of autism symptoms. The most popular product from
