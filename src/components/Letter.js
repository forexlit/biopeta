      <strong className="block text-lg mb-5">My energy levels went up.</strong>
      <p>I am not dragging myself through the day anymore.</p>
      <p>It helps that I’m not putting that much weight on my knees anymore.</p>
      <p>
        But I used to blame my tiredness on everything but my stress and
        anxiety...
      </p>

      <strong className="block text-lg mb-5 mt-5">
        I started losing weight. Finally.
      </strong>
      <p>Currently, I’m over 50 lbs down. </p>
      <p> I can’t explain how great that feels.</p>
      <p>
        My clothes fit me again, and I don’t feel guilty eating carbs anymore…
      </p>
      <p>
        And while I still have a few more pounds to lose, I’m looking a lot more
        toned.
      </p>
      <p>
        With my newfound energy, I added simple home exercises to my routine,
        enhancing my results (which is a nice bonus, but not necessary.)
      </p>
      <p>
        But more than the numbers, it’s the tone in my arms and belly and
        strength I’ve gained that excite me.
      </p>

        I am not burned out at work anymore

      <p>The cortisol drastically reduced my stress and anxiety.</p>

      <p>
        It’s like I’ve broken free from a cycle of constant pressure and fatigue
        I never thought I’d escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll admit that going through it, I thought I would have to suffer and
        completely overhaul my lifestyle, but it was a steady journey,
        introducing small habits that I could maintain in the long run.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, I find joy in activities and foods I’d previously ignored – methods
        that soothe and energize me without the crippling anxiety behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t just about managing cortisol; it’s about loving how I live.
        Every day feels like a choice for my well-being.
      </p>

      <strong className="block text-lg mb-5 mt-5">
        I am not burned out at work anymore
      </strong>
      <p>
        There’s been a noticeable shift in my mood and overall mental health.
      </p>

      <p>I’m more myself than I’ve been in years!</p>
      <p>
        I’m not as tired anymore and low spirits have lifted, replaced by a
        steady stream of positivity and energy.
      </p>

      <p>This journey has done wonders for my self-esteem.</p>

      <p>
        Losing the weight is one thing, but gaining confidence? That’s
        priceless.
